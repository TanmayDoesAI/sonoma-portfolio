# macOS Sonoma-Themed Portfolio

This is a portfolio website designed to simulate the macOS Sonoma desktop environment. Each folder represents a different section of the portfolio (About Me, Experience, Projects, Education, Listen), and clicking on the folders reveals files with detailed content about each topic. The goal is to provide a creative, interactive way to showcase my professional journey, skills, and projects.
